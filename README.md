# ppt-web-crawling
Using requests and BeautifulSoup to crawl the title, content, and comments of a thread in ptt.

I modified some scripts I found from several websites and created this script where the title, content and comments of 
a post can be extracted individually. You can use this script to obtain texts from ptt and do further analysis or language
processing,
